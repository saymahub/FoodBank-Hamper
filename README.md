# ENSF409-W22Project

This program would be used in food banks to create hampers for families of different sizes with different nutritional needs. The user will input information for their family and is able to request multiple hampers for more than one family. Once the program is complete, a .txt file called OrderForm will output, consisting of the original request made by the user and the least wasteful combination, to the best of the program's abilty, of foods from the inventory that will meet the family's needs for an entire week. The program also considers if the user needs mobility accomodation. This project is completed using VSCode in the Java language, utilizing concepts explored throughout the semester. The entire project consists of 8 .java files, 1 JUnit test file, 1 UML diagram, a video demonstation, and a sample order form created by the program.

Extraction: Extract the file and ensure to copy all folders ("edu" to "ensf409") into your desired location. Essentially, you should only move "edu," do not remove or change the folders and files within "edu"!

Compilation: Compile all 8 files within the innermost file. Reconnect your food_inventory SQL database and execute all. Ensure your terminal is in the correct directory (within the same folder as edu) and enter the following command: javac -cp .;lib/junit-4.13.2.jar;lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar edu/ucalgary/ensf409/*.java

Running Program: To run this program in its package, keep the terminal's directory to the folder that contains "edu" and enter the following command: java -cp .;lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar edu/ucalgary/ensf409/GUIFoodBank

Note: You can find the final orderform in the same folder that "edu" and your input file is located. The lines of the UML differ in colour to make it easier to read due to some unavoidable overlapping of lines. The files named "62.pdf" and "Tests.java" are past deliverables. The video demonstration was too large to upload onto GitHub. However, it is included in the D2L submission.
